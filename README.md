This project is to use Java to create an English to Pig Latin translator.

# Rules for Pig Latin

Here are the rules for Pig Latin.

Take the English word and do the following:

- Put the first letter at the end
- add `ay` after

Here are some single word examples.

- tree => reetay
- coding => odingcay
- phone => honepay

Here is a sentence example. Note that you leave words with a single letter alone; they are not converted.

- I love coding
- I oveay odingcay
